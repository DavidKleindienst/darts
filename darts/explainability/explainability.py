        Return explanations values for each target and covariates lag, in a multivariate TimeSeries format.
        Each timestamp of the foreground TimeSeries is explained in the output TimeSeries, with the following
        notation:
        `name`_`type_of_cov`_lag_`int`

        Example:
        Let's say we have a model with 2 targets (multivariates) names T_1 and T_2, one past covariate and one
        future covariate. Also, n = 2 and past_step_explained = 2.

        Then the function is supposed to return a dictionary time series, with for example

        output[0]['T_1'] (but also output[1]['T_1'], output[0]['T_2'] and output[1]['T_2']a TimeSeries
        with the following components:
            - T_1_target_lag-1
            - T_1_target_lag-2
            - 0_past_cov_lag-1 (we didn't name the past covariate so it took the default name)
            - 0_past_cov_lag-2
            - 0_fut_cov_lag_0 (could be also lag_1 if output[1])

        # TODO: improve description of returned structure


        Parameters
        ----------
        foreground_series
            TimeSeries target we want to explain. Can be multivariate.
        foreground_past_covariates
            Optionally, past covariate timeseries if needed by model.
        foreground_future_covariates
            Optionally, future covariate timeseries if needed by model.
        horizons
            Optionally, a list of integer values representing which elements in the future
            we want to explain, starting from the first timestamp prediction at 0.
            For now we consider only models with output_chunk_length and it can't be bigger than
            output_chunk_length.
            If no input, then all elements of output_chunk_length will be explained.
        target_names
            Optionally, a list of strings naming the components of `foreground_series` we want to explain.
            If no input, then all targets will be explained.

        Returns
        -------
        a TimeSeries or dictionary of Timeseries of explaining values :
            - each element of the first dictionary is corresponding to an horizon
            - each element of the second layer dictionary is corresponding to a target
