      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            The length of the input sequence fed to the model.
        output_chunk_length
            The length of the forecast of the model.
        individual
            A linear layer for each variate (channel) individually (default='False').
        enc_in
            Then number of channels when individual is used (default='10').
        **kwargs
            Optional arguments to initialize the pytorch_lightning.Module, pytorch_lightning.Trainer, and
            Darts' :class:`TorchForecastingModel`.

        loss_fn
            PyTorch loss function used for training.
            This parameter will be ignored for probabilistic models if the ``likelihood`` parameter is specified.
            Default: ``torch.nn.MSELoss()``.
        likelihood
            One of Darts' :meth:`Likelihood <darts.utils.likelihood_models.Likelihood>` models to be used for
            probabilistic forecasts. Default: ``None``.
        torch_metrics
            A torch metric or a ``MetricCollection`` used for evaluation. A full list of available metrics can be found
            at https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. Default: ``None``.
        optimizer_cls
            The PyTorch optimizer class to be used. Default: ``torch.optim.Adam``.
        optimizer_kwargs
            Optionally, some keyword arguments for the PyTorch optimizer (e.g., ``{'lr': 1e-3}``
            for specifying a learning rate). Otherwise, the default values of the selected ``optimizer_cls``
            will be used. Default: ``None``.
        lr_scheduler_cls
            Optionally, the PyTorch learning rate scheduler class to be used. Specifying ``None`` corresponds
            to using a constant learning rate. Default: ``None``.
        lr_scheduler_kwargs
            Optionally, some keyword arguments for the PyTorch learning rate scheduler. Default: ``None``.
        batch_size
            Number of time series (input and output sequences) used in each training pass. Default: ``32``.
        n_epochs
            Number of epochs over which to train the model. Default: ``100``.
        model_name
            Name of the model. Used for creating checkpoints and saving tensorboard data. If not specified,
            defaults to the following string ``"YYYY-mm-dd_HH:MM:SS_torch_model_run_PID"``, where the initial part
            of the name is formatted with the local date and time, while PID is the processed ID (preventing models
            spawned at the same time by different processes to share the same model_name). E.g.,
            ``"2021-06-14_09:53:32_torch_model_run_44607"``.
        work_dir
            Path of the working directory, where to save checkpoints and Tensorboard summaries.
            Default: current working directory.
        log_tensorboard
            If set, use Tensorboard to log the different parameters. The logs will be located in:
            ``"{work_dir}/darts_logs/{model_name}/logs/"``. Default: ``False``.
        nr_epochs_val_period
            Number of epochs to wait before evaluating the validation loss (if a validation
            ``TimeSeries`` is passed to the :func:`fit()` method). Default: ``1``.
        torch_device_str
            Optionally, a string indicating the torch device to use. By default, ``torch_device_str`` is ``None``
            which will run on CPU. Set it to ``"cuda"`` to use all available GPUs or ``"cuda:i"`` to only use
            GPU ``i`` (``i`` must be an integer). For example "cuda:0" will use the first GPU only.

            .. deprecated:: v0.17.0
                ``torch_device_str`` has been deprecated in v0.17.0 and will be removed in a future version.
                Instead, specify this with keys ``"accelerator", "devices", "auto_select_gpus"`` in your
                ``pl_trainer_kwargs`` dict. Some examples for setting the devices inside the ``pl_trainer_kwargs``
                dict:

                - ``{"accelerator": "cpu"}`` for CPU,
                - ``{"accelerator": "gpu", "devices": [i]}`` to use only GPU ``i`` (``i`` must be an integer),
                - ``{"accelerator": "gpu", "devices": -1, "auto_select_gpus": True}`` to use all available GPUS.

                For more info, see here:
                https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common/trainer.html#trainer-flags , and
                https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/multi_gpu.html#select-gpu-devices
        force_reset
            If set to ``True``, any previously-existing model with the same name will be reset (all checkpoints will
            be discarded). Default: ``False``.
        save_checkpoints
            Whether or not to automatically save the untrained model and checkpoints from training.
            To load the model from checkpoint, call :func:`MyModelClass.load_from_checkpoint()`, where
            :class:`MyModelClass` is the :class:`TorchForecastingModel` class that was used (such as :class:`TFTModel`,
            :class:`NBEATSModel`, etc.). If set to ``False``, the model can still be manually saved using
            :func:`save_model()` and loaded using :func:`load_model()`. Default: ``False``.
        add_encoders
            A large number of past and future covariates can be automatically generated with `add_encoders`.
            This can be done by adding multiple pre-defined index encoders and/or custom user-made functions that
            will be used as index encoders. Additionally, a transformer such as Darts' :class:`Scaler` can be added to
            transform the generated covariates. This happens all under one hood and only needs to be specified at
            model creation.
            Read :meth:`SequentialEncoder <darts.utils.data.encoders.SequentialEncoder>` to find out more about
            ``add_encoders``. Default: ``None``. An example showing some of ``add_encoders`` features:

            .. highlight:: python
            .. code-block:: python

                add_encoders={
                    'cyclic': {'future': ['month']},
                    'datetime_attribute': {'future': ['hour', 'dayofweek']},
                    'position': {'past': ['absolute'], 'future': ['relative']},
                    'custom': {'past': [lambda idx: (idx.year - 1950) / 50]},
                    'transformer': Scaler()
                }
            ..
        random_state
            Control the randomness of the weights initialization. Check this
            `link <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-random_state>`_ for more details.
            Default: ``None``.
        pl_trainer_kwargs
            By default :class:`TorchForecastingModel` creates a PyTorch Lightning Trainer with several useful presets
            that performs the training, validation and prediction processes. These presets include automatic
            checkpointing, tensorboard logging, setting the torch device and more.
            With ``pl_trainer_kwargs`` you can add additional kwargs to instantiate the PyTorch Lightning trainer
            object. Check the `PL Trainer documentation
            <https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common/trainer.html>`_ for more information about the
            supported kwargs. Default: ``None``.
            Running on GPU(s) is also possible using ``pl_trainer_kwargs`` by specifying keys ``"accelerator",
            "devices", and "auto_select_gpus"``. Some examples for setting the devices inside the ``pl_trainer_kwargs``
            dict:

                - ``{"accelerator": "cpu"}`` for CPU,
                - ``{"accelerator": "gpu", "devices": [i]}`` to use only GPU ``i`` (``i`` must be an integer),
                - ``{"accelerator": "gpu", "devices": -1, "auto_select_gpus": True}`` to use all available GPUS.

                For more info, see here:
                https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common/trainer.html#trainer-flags , and
                https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/accelerators/gpu_basic.html#train-on-multiple-gpus
            With parameter ``"callbacks"`` you can add custom or PyTorch-Lightning built-in callbacks to Darts'
            :class:`TorchForecastingModel`. Below is an example for adding EarlyStopping to the training process.
            The model will stop training early if the validation loss `val_loss` does not improve beyond
            specifications. For more information on callbacks, visit:
            `PyTorch Lightning Callbacks
            <https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extensions/callbacks.html>`_

            .. highlight:: python
            .. code-block:: python

                from pytorch_lightning.callbacks.early_stopping import EarlyStopping

                # stop training when validation loss does not decrease more than 0.05 (`min_delta`) over
                # a period of 5 epochs (`patience`)
                my_stopper = EarlyStopping(
                    monitor="val_loss",
                    patience=5,
                    min_delta=0.05,
                    mode='min',
                )

                pl_trainer_kwargs={"callbacks": [my_stopper]}
            ..

            Note that you can also use a custom PyTorch Lightning Trainer for training and prediction with optional
            parameter ``trainer`` in :func:`fit()` and :func:`predict()`.
        show_warnings
            whether to show warnings raised from PyTorch Lightning. Useful to detect potential issues of
            your forecasting use case. Default: ``False``.
